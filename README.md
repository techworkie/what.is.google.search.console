Google search console is a free service provided by Google which gives webmasters access to a number of tools and reports for optimizing their websites on Google search. It is an updated version of what was previously known as Google Webmaster tools.

## What can you do with Google Search Console?
You can use Google search console to optimize your website for technical SEO, understand what Google knows about your website and view historical data about your website’s performance on Google.

You can find below a breakdown of all Google search console functions by area.


## How Google Search Console can benefit you?

If you’re a recent website owner, you should start simple to not overcomplicate it for yourself. Install Google Search Console and let it be a helping hand. However, don’t get us wrong; you can use Search Console even if you are a seasoned website owner and have a small or large business. 

The first thing you should do is check your search traffic in the performance report offered by the Search Console and try to understand which queries, pages, and countries are driving your traffic. 

This type of information is solid gold and very helpful. Knowing the reason behind your online traffic will enable you to optimise your website. For example, if you know a specific query leads people to your website, you know that you should focus on that query and similar queries. The same applies to pages; you can optimise the pages that aren’t driving traffic to your website to turn the trend around. Finally, as you grow your business, you can focus on countries leading traffic to your website simultaneously as you put efforts into, for example, marketing activities in other countries that aren’t performing that well. 

Once you’re happy with your business plan and marketing activities, you should use Search Console to ensure that all your pages have been crawled and indexed. You don’t want people to miss out on all the content you’re publishing. Furthermore, you can monitor to see if GSC finds any errors on your website when it indexes your pages. Basically, you can analyse your entire website with the help of Search Console.
